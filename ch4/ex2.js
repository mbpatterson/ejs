//Write two functions, reverseArray and reverseArrayInPlace. THe first, reverseArray
// takes an array as an argument and produces a new array that has the same elements
// in the inverse order. The second, reverseArrayInPlace, does that the reverse method
// does: it modifies the array given as argument in order to reverse its elements. 
//Neither may use the standard reverse method
